10:41 AM | Soniya from smallcase: Hello there, 
 How may I help you?

10:42 AM | Mohd Uzaif: Hi yesterday I placed a sell order of my green energy smallcase of 373000 
 And immediately bought 284813 of green energy again 
 And bought remaining of 373000 today

10:43 AM | Mohd Uzaif: But in my upstox account my holdings are showing returns from various months

10:43 AM | Mohd Uzaif: In other words my holdings are not being showed

10:45 AM | Mohd Uzaif: Why is that happening 
Or does it take some time to remove the stocks from my upstox account holdings?

10:48 AM | Mohd Uzaif: As you can see there should not be 30% profit as I bought some yesterday and remaining today

10:50 AM | Mohd Uzaif: [Image "IMG_8782.png?expires=1711635446&signature=c938a1b5a8d56e45da88d59d8537708235eddb46ef906b7a51903babf98108fb"]

11:00 AM | Soniya from smallcase: Hello there, 
 We can see that all your orders are executed on smallcase platform. Could you please check your positions for your orders placed today and your tradebook for the orders place yesterday.

11:17 AM | Mohd Uzaif: yes in the trades it is showing but why then the holdings are not updated till now even after i sold all these stocks yesterday

11:29 AM | Soniya from smallcase: Could you please check with your broker support once? They have all the tools to check the details. It will be easy for you to understand.

06:09 PM | Mohd Uzaif: Hi please reopen my chat as you told I tried emailing Upstox customer support as well but it‚Äôs been a week that they haven‚Äôt provided any solution.

06:10 PM | Mohd Uzaif: What should I do? I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. 
 Clearly there‚Äôs a mismatch in what the holdings that are being shown in Upstox and what the trades pdf is showing..

06:11 PM | Mohd Uzaif: Should I email Sebi or cdsl about all this?

06:11 PM | Balaakrishnan from smallcase: Hi there 
 
 Apologies for the inconvenience, please share your upstox holding and tradebook details.

06:11 PM | Balaakrishnan from smallcase: https://keystone.upstox.com//tradewise-report

06:12 PM | Balaakrishnan from smallcase: Attached is your overall holdings in your smallcase. Please check if you see any discrepany between smallcase and upstox holdings. 
 [Attachment: "topLevelHoldings_28_3_2024.csv"]

06:13 PM | Mohd Uzaif: Okay

06:14 PM | Balaakrishnan from smallcase: Thank you. Let us know if you see any mismatch in holding values.

06:58 PM | Mohd Uzaif: There clearly is a mismatch in buying and selling price that is shown in upstox holdings in the transactions that were done through smallcase on 21 March and 22 March 
 
Even though upstox tradebook shows the exact same data as smallcase but upstox holdings are having a mismatch even in app version as well as web version.

06:59 PM | Mohd Uzaif: do you want me to share the trade pdf as well as holdings screenshot to prove?

07:00 PM | Balaakrishnan from smallcase: Yes, please share upstox tradebook and holding details here. Please share downloaded files.

07:00 PM | Mohd Uzaif: [Attachment: "trade_2324_5MB94T.pdf"]

07:01 PM | Mohd Uzaif: so these are the transactions of 21 March and 22 March

07:03 PM | Mohd Uzaif: [Image "upstoxsssss.png?expires=1711635446&signature=37bfe8d1099554b95f1476bda310f85488f52e533f8194b810765a5a3f1a7fe0"]

07:06 PM | Mohd Uzaif: here take example of sanghvi movers stock, here in holdings its average buy price is 571. 
 But in reality currently it should be 1174 according to smallcase data as well as tradebook data. 
 some other stocks have this issue as well. 
 You can verify.

07:17 PM | Mohd Uzaif: if you want all holdings screenshot i will send you do tell me!
