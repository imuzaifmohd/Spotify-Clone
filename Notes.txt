1) set overflow hidden for * as we dont require scroll bar for everything

2) used flex:1   ->    so that .main-content div takes all the remaining width after sidebar

3) border radius, padding, margin set to 1rem   -> so that when screen size chota hoga to border radius bhi choti hogi

4) setted line heigt of a class of of divs in rem

5) font size, icons font size also set in terms of rem

6) setted height of one of main divs in pixel but height of child in rem 

7) i already got to know that to avoid overflow of content from div we use
							overflow:hidden;    and      border box box sizing
				But surpisingly padding is also helpful in this, while i was stuck and tried upper two things 
				but what solved my problem was by just giving padding.

8) *{box-sizing: border-box;}: 	Use it every time for all so that when giving padding doesnâ€™t increase the overall box size.
